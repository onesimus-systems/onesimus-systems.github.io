In order to distinguish between my personal website and projects and those of Onesimus Systems, I've decided to move the official Onesimus Systems website to its GitHub organization. The URL has been transfered as well. The old site, which is now [http://lfkeitel.github.io](http://lfkeitel.github.io), will consist of my personal blog, projects, and other stuff.

With the website transfer, I will also be transferring the Dandelion repo to the organization. Again to distinguish between projects I want to be personal, and those I want to be "professional".

Well, that's about it. The source for this site is available at [http://github.com/onesimus-systems/onesimus-systems.github.io](http://github.com/onesimus-systems/onesimus-systems.github.io).
