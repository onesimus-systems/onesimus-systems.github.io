Onesimus Systems began in Fall 2013 out of a passion to write and learn about software. In particular web applications and their place in modern technology. Out of this came the first project called Dandelion ([source](https://github.com/onesimus-systems/dandelion)). Since then many more projects have been created each of them helping to grow and shape the way development is done.

All projects from Onesimus are available at the GitHub page [github.com/onesimus-systems](https://github.com/onesimus-systems). All projects are released as open-source software. Use them, learn from them, and contribute so that together we can build something amazing.
